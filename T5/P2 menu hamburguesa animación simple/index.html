    <h1>The world's best hamburger</h1>
    <div id="parrafada"><p>At any time of the day, nothing is more appealing than a delicious hamburger menu.
         Its spectacular animation (full of details and magic) gives a stunning dash of pizzazz to even
          the simplest of web pages. CSS makes us so extremely happy that, without a doubt, designing a beautiful
           hamburger menu was the best thing that could happen to us on a day like today.
            Click on the menu at the right hand side to visualize our wonderful creation,
             feel the pride of a job well done and possibly dream of the bright future that awaits us
              as Front-end Developers in the best companies in the world.</p></div>
