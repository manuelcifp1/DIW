        <p>Can you remember life before memes? If you’re under 30, probably not.
             Internet memes can take various forms, such as images, videos, GIFs,
              and various other viral sensations. Characteristics of memes include
               their susceptibility to parody, their use of intertextuality,
                their propagation in a viral pattern, and their evolution over time.
                 To pay tribute to some of the most culturally important works of art
                  in the history of humankind, here are the funniest memes of all time.</p>

            <h2>Grumpy Cat</h2>
            <img src="./img/01.jpg" alt="grumpy cat" class="img-izquierda">
            <p>Grumpy Cat graced the Internet’s presence
                 for the first time on Reddit in 2012 and
                  went viral within hours. Unfortunately,
                   Grumpy Cat (aka Tardar Sauce) died in 2019,
                    but her spirit, frowny face, and place in the Meme Hall
                     of Fame live on forever. According to owner Tabitha Bundesen,
                      her facial expression was caused by feline dwarfism
                       and an underbite. Grumpy Cat travelled the world making
                        television appearances and in 2014 even starred in her own
                         Christmas film. Madame Tussauds in San Francisco unveiled
                          a waxwork of her in 2015.</p>

            <h2>Squinty Fry from Futurama</h2>
            <img src="./img/02.jpg" alt="squinty fry" class="img-derecha">
            <p>Feeling a little confused or skeptical? We give you this screengrab
                 from Season 2, Episode 6 of Futurama, “The Lesser of Two Evils.”
                  It offers the best facial expression for all those moments
                   of I’m not quite sure, but something doesn’t feel right here.
                    Also evidenced in all photos from our last birthday party.
                      In the weeks leading up to the start of the Futurama
                       new season in 2012, Comedy Central aired several commercials
                        featuring Fry using the style and phrasal template of
                         "Not Sure if X". Amongst original ones, these also used
                          featured various popular versions of the phrase found online.
                           On June 20th, 2012, Fry appeared at the end of the opening
                            sequence of the new episode in the style of the phrasal template
                             along with the caption "Not sure if new episode, or just rerun of episode I watched drunk".</p>

            <h2>Shocked Pikachu</h2>
            <img src="./img/03.jpg" alt="shocked Pikachu" class="img-izquierda">
            <p>Feign surprise with Pikachu on your side using this meme that showcases
                 a screenshot from the anime Pokémon. The episode the image originated
                  from is Season 1, Episode 10 at exactly the 3:05 time mark
                   But it was in late 2018 when the Internet started pairing surprised
                    Pikachu with captions that showed surprise despite a predictable
                     outcome. Though its origins date back to the ’90s,
                      Shocked Pikachu didn’t make its appearance on the internet
                       until 2018. According to Know Your Meme, a Tumblr user,
                        named Angela, is the brainchild behind the meme.
                         Angela said that her love for Pokemon gave birth
                          to Shocked Pikachu. In an interview, Angela said
                           that she rewatched the original Pokemon and noticed
                            that the character “looked a bit… off.” She then
                             started screen-grabbing scenes of Pikachu and other
                              Pokemon that confirmed that suspicion.</p>

            <h2>Pointing Spider-Men</h2>
            <img src="./img/04.jpg" alt="pointing Spidermen" class="img-derecha">
            <p>This meme, which started taking off in the mid 2010’s on Black Twitter
                 and went viral thanks to FreddyAmazin’s Twitter post and a Reddit post,
                  features an image from a 1960’s episode of the Spider-Man cartoon
                   where two people in Spider-Man costumes are pointing at each other.
                    Just place a mirror in front of us and it’s basically us.
                     The screenshot first began to circulate as a meme in 2011,
                      often accompanied by captions such as "No U" and "Ha! Look
                       at that loser." The meme circulated quickly and began to
                        take on more specific meanings. It was used to make fun
                         of different people or groups acting similarly to one another,
                          often while they maintained how different they were.</p>
